data science:
it is used to extract the data for the meaningful insights that can learn from the data for the bp

it is used to solve complex problems with the help of math and stat

with the help of machine learning we can perform the predictions


Data?---raw collection of data

information of facts


types of data analysis:

descriptive analytics(what happened)
diagnostic analytics(why did it happened)
predictive analytics(what will happen)
prescriptive analytics(what to do now)


life cycle of project:
1.understanding the business problem
2.collecting the data
3.preprocessing the data
4.cleaning the data
5.exploratory data analysis(eda)
6.feature engineering
7.model building
8.model evaluation
9.deployement

machine learning:
it learns from the data to predict future values

types of ml:
supervised learning
unsupervised learning
semi supervised learning
reinforcement

deep learning:
it mimics like a human brain

neural networks

input layer---->hidden layer---->output layer

nlp:(natural language processing):

it makes computers to understand and to interpret the human languages

Ai:(Artificial intelligence)

gen ai:generative ai

it is used to generate the new content like text,images,audios and even videos with the help of patterns that can learn from the data

gen ai models:

chat gpt
gemini
perplexity
copilot
gemma
claude
grok
deepseek

generative ai models:(algorithms):

1.GANS(Generative adversarial neural networks)
2.VAES(variational auto encoders)
3.Transformers(modern form of nlp)

langchain:it is a framework which is used to integrate llms

Rag(retrieval augumented generation)
